            <p class="ab-pra">As an Executive Chef, Chef Cho brings years of culinary expertise to the kitchen of TTiffany Cafe & Restaurant, and together with her a vibrancy in her food offering. At a young age, Chef Cho was inspired by her parents who are chefs, and with her aspirations, it led her to the path of gastronomy. Chef Cho took on her first job at Singapore in 1990, where she developed and refined her culinary techniques.
             Chef Cho’s repertoire includes five-star hotels, prestigious Italian restaurants, steak houses and more, which enabled her to be well-versed in both local and western cuisine. To stay relevant in today’s ever-changing food scene, Chef Cho equips herself with skills by going for courses, and experiments with food innovation.            
             The journey as a chef was filled with challenges, since years back, the culinary scene was more male-dominated. However, that did not deter Chef Cho from striving to give her best and coupled with passion, flourished to the Executive Chef she is today.</p>
